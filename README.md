# Snowrunner Manual Transmission

This mod disables SnowRunner's automatic shitbox transmission. \
Shifting can either be done with the game's ui shifter and keybinds to shift up/down in the auto position (IMMERSIVE MODE) or completely with keybinds (DISABLE GAME SHIFTING).

## Installation

1. Get the latest release [here.](https://github.com/drafty46/SMT/releases/latest)
2. Extract files from archive into game folder, next to SnowRunner.exe.
3. The mod will load on game launch.

#### Use [this subscribe mod](https://mod.io/g/snowrunner/m/manual-text-for-shifter#description) to change the shifter text from AUTO {gear} to GEAR {gear}

## Usage

The mod's menu, where all configuration is done, is bound to the deleste key by default.

To change a keybind left click on it's blue box, press the desired key/keys and then right click on the box to confirm. \
**NOTE: For axis that return to one end like pedals you need to confirm before releasing them.**    \
To clear an already set keybind right click on it's box. \
Changes take effect immediately but aren't saved unless you use the save button.

**Ranges** - use this if you don't have a physical range toggle. There's LOW, NORMAL and HIGH.  \
Cycling up/down is done with 'RANGE LOW'/'RANGE HIGH' keybinds. (**Must be a single button**)   \
When selected, LOW/HIGH simulate their key being pressed, so bind the same button for the range + the actual button to press.
